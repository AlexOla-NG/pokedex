## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Router, Axios, Framer-motion, React-Paginate
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project, I learnt how to prevent a useEffect from running on the first render.

### Continued development

I had some challenge with getting the react-skeleton library to work properly. Maybe it'll feature in my next project.

### Useful resources

- [FontAwesome Search](https://fontawesome.com/search) - This is the search page for font awesome icons.
- [How to use setState callback on react hooks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61612292) - This showed how to use a state value immediately after calling setState. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Suppress Chrome 'Failed to load resource' messages in console](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4500741/suppress-chrome-failed-to-load-resource-messages-in-console/30847631#30847631) - This helped to clear the console when error messages were logged after a 404 request. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [FontAwesome Icons Spin only on mouseover?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21030259/fontawesome-icons-spin-only-on-mouseover) - This helped us add font awesome animation via css to font awesome icons. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [The Simplest Guide to Using Async/Await with forEach() in JavaScript (with Examples)](https://plainenglish.io/blog/async-await-foreach) - This showed me alternatives to using forEach with async/await. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
