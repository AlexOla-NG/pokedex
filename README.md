## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Router, Axios, Framer-motion, React-Paginate
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project, I learned how to source assets more effectively. I think my googling skills got levelled up at some pointüòÅ.

### Continued development

I had some challenge with the animation & transition effects. I originally intended to use Framer.Motion, but time was too short to get into that. Maybe it'll feature in my next portfolio.
