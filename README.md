## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Router, Axios, Framer-motion, React-Paginate
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project, I:

- learnt how to prevent a useEffect from running on the first render.
- got more practice with conditionally rendering.

### Continued development

I had some challenge with getting the react-skeleton library to work properly. Maybe it'll feature in a future project.
